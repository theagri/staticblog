#Static Blog
Powered by PHP and Markdown.

##Why?
Because I got tired of using [My other engine](https://github.com/kallepersson/sjeugam), which wasn't even static. I wanted something even more lightweight, so I wrote this during a train ride.

##Installation:
* Clone the repo
* Edit `MB_BASE_URL` in `generate.php` to match your setup.
* Create the folder "src"
* Put your markdown-flavored entries in 
* Run `php generate.php`
* The entries in src are now html files, and are displayed on the front page.

##TODO:
* RSS feed
* A real archive
* Perhaps something else, idk. :)
